### About Project

This is my first try at building a photo gallery using HTML and CSS.
Using some images from my favorite comics, the X-MEN by MARVEL COMICS and a font from Google Fonts.
I worked on transparency, positioning and hover effect to animate the polaroid-like images.

### How to use this Project

Hovering over the semi-transparent gray images, they move in a straight position and get top 100% opacity and color.
